# TwoClocks
12&amp;24hourClock

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving;
  This project was made to show to slocks on the screen at the same time. One clock in 12 hour format and the other in 24 hour format.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I think that what I did particularly well was making the clocks continuously add one sec while waiting for the user input,
  and after the user input the clocks went back to continuously adding one sec until the user added more time manually or quit.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could have enhanced my code by breaking it up into more classes in order to make it more efficient and secure.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The part of the code that I found the most challenging was getting the clocks to continuously add one sec while waiting for the user input. The way that I
  overcame this was by reading documentation, and looking on stackoverflow.com, which are both a big part of my support network along with Slack.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I would have to say that I learned alot of new skills while trying to figure out how to get this code to work the way that I wanted it to, which are skills
  that I will also be able to use on projects that I do in the future. One of the skills that I learned was #include <conio.h> while using !_kbhit in order 
  to let the code run the program until the user makes a selction from the display menu.
  
 How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made it readable by using appropriate naming and inline comments, but I believe that I could have done better with my file management by having a time.cpp instead
  of everything being in the time.h file, I could have also maybe spread the code out over one or two more classes, One to display the menu and one for setting the
  initial time at the start of the program.
